           <p>Historically, getting new clothes was a rarity. Clothing used to be handmade by craftsmen and sold for large amount of money. Clothing was used to show status in society and wealth. People would pass down their clothing or even remake the textiles into something else they can wear to not waste any material. However, in the early 2000s this all changed. Clothing brands were now able mass produce products like never before. Clothing trends became something heavily followed by the public. Trends began to change by season, causing people to get rid of their old clothes and buy new ones every few months. The fast cycle of this clothing being mass produced became coined as “fast fashion”. Fast fashion is known to be inexpensive clothing that resembles current, popular trends made popular by celebrities or the runway. The idea behind this mass production by companies is to allow customers to get current styles out as quickly as possible. While this might seem like a great way for people to get affordable clothing, it has caused overproduction, making the fashion industry the biggest source of pollution in the world. </p>
